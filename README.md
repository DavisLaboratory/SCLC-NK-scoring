## Overview


## Data
This project analyses several public data sources on SCLC, including a patient cohort study by George *et al* (2015), and small cell lung cancer data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE).

### Data Sources
George, J *et al.* (2015). *Nature*. **524**, pp. 47â€“53.
- DOI: [10.1038/nature14664](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14664)
- In particular, the [supplementary data tables](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature14664/MediaObjects/41586_2015_BFnature14664_MOESM72_ESM.xlsx).
  - Note that the transcript abundance data have been embedded within an Excel spreadsheet and accordingly a subset of gene names have been corrupted due to date autoconversion.
